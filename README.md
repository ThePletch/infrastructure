# infrastructure

A repository for the cloud configuration used by my various applications and personal cloud-based services, like my email forwarding. Most of my stuff is still being migrated here.

If you're reading this to try and find vulnerabilities in my application config, I welcome your attempts.

### Migration status

TO MIGRATE

- [ ] Personal static site bucket and deployment config
- [ ] Parties site config (and eventually serverless config)
- [ ] DNS in general
- [ ] MBTA site hosting and deployment (and the caching proxy)
- [ ] SSL certs
- [X] Terraform backend config (so meta)

TO SET UP

- [X] Email forwarding module for taking incoming emails without Namecheap
